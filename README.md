# CLI library management system in C

A university project to implement a linked list using pure C programming language for the purpose of managing a library by an administrator.

Date of completion: 9/30/2020.

Important note: while I realize it is not a good practice to include the whole code in a single file, this was required by the professor to make grading easier.

## Functionality: 

the program prompts the user for a command number after providing the main menu which is a list of possible commands which are:

           1. Show books
           2. Add a book
           3. Update a book
           4. Remove a book
           5. Show customers
           6. Add a customer
           7. Update a customer
           8. Remove a customer
           9. Quit

Then for each command, the program implements the required functionality and prompts the user back to the main menu until the user chooses to quit.

## Possible improvements:
The application could be integrated with a database in order to keep persistent.
